You are under a potential moderate risk, meaning a non-serious damage to your physical, psychological, legal or digital integrity. Insults, bad treatment, defamation campaigns, some cyber-attacks, are examples of these risks. Some of those attacks are leading up to more serious risks. Evaluate what operation is putting you in higher levels of risk. Be aware of any corrective actions you need to take and eliminate any unacceptable risk. You will probably need to improve some prevention protocols.

Immediate steps:

- Action 1: Analyze any operation that could increase your risk level.

- Action 2: Talk to your media organizations and discuss regularly with your colleagues about the security environment.

- Action 3. Create and maintain networks of support.

- Action 4: Get familiar to these organizations in case of need:

b) [Reporters Without Borders](http://en.rsf.org/a-hotline-for-journalists-in-17-04-2007,21749.html)

c) [International News Safety Institute](http://www.newssafety.org/contact/ )

d) [Article 19](http://www.article19.org/pages/en/contact-us.html)

- Other courses of action:

-- Create a security strategy: A security strategy is a document revised periodically which outlines the major security concerns of a person or media organization and outlines plans to reduce risks and face those concerns. 

-- You need to discuss this situation with your media organization and conduct an in-depth analysis of the threats you are facing, the main vulnerabilities and strengths you have, and set up new goals according to the new circumstances.

-- Create security protocols. A protocol is a sequence of operations that ensure your physical, psychological, legal or digital security.

-- Create and follow preventive protocols to face current potential threats, increase your capacities and work to reduce vulnerabilities. 

-- Prepare yourself for sudden changes in your security level.
