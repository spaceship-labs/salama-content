# Do you cover corruption?

You often cover corruption. It is important for you to identify on a regular basis any source of risk. Because in our countries, investigative journalists are usually challenged in courts, you may need to strengthen your verification methods and make sure your data is bullet-proofed against libel lawsuits. You also need to have security protocols to decide what course of action you need in case of hostil acts or aggression from actors involved in corruption. Your protocols have to determine what to do during and after the process of investigation.

If you cover corruption and your colleagues have suffered attacks, you will need to identify what threats to journalists are active in your area, and determine if they are potential or actual. It is important to know what are the capacities of those groups of power and how willing they are to attack journalists.

Solid verification and bulletproofing methods help journalists to mitigate judicial threats. Based on threat analysis, you can build security protocols to help you to decide the best courses of action in case of an aggression from corrupt officials. These protocols should help you to decide the best actions before, during and after your stories are published. You need to fully understand cases of aggression against your media organization and adapt you security protocols to that condition.

Journalists who cover corruption need to have their own security strategy. They need to protect several aspects:

- Protect your data. Journalists investigating corruption have faced attacks attempting to destroy evidence. In some cases, the attack aims to take the entire computer or computers away from the reporter. Your data should be encrypted and backed up safely. 

- Protect your sources. If you have anonymous sources, you may want to follow a security protocol to protect their identities from an adversary. 

- Protect your meetings. If you think you are under a targeted surveillance, you must avoid using your mobile phone to set up meetings or contacting sensitive sources. Your computer might be compromised, so you need to take precautions if you think your computer is infected and avoid using it for communications.

- Protect yourself with independence and professionalism. You need to report in a fair and balanced manner, always offering the target of your investigation an opportunity to respond to any allegation.

- Be independent from your sources. Don’t accept gifts or privileges from them. Avoid treating them or being treated as “a friend”.

- Do not reveal personal information in social networks.
