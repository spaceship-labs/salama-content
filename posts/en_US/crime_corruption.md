# Do you cover crime or corruption? 
Journalists who often cover crime and corruption are at very high risk. According to research from the Committee to Protect Journalists, 35 per cent of journalists killed worldwide since 1992 used to cover both topics. There are several reasons for this spike of risk: Journalists’ work impact impunity of corrupt police or intelligence agents, criminals, human rights violators, or corrupted business people. This impact increases risk for journalists. In some countries with high crime rates, criminal groups and security forces have become clear adversaries and sources of threats against journalists.
CPJ asks journalists to keep in mind that the greater risk is not investigating the criminal organizations themselves but their connection to governmental officers who protect them.
 
**These are some advices:**

- Conduct an in-depth research before entering the criminal environment.

- Get a deep understanding of the criminal organizations operating in the area.

- Planning is crucial. It has to include a risk assessment, a security plan if the reporter or a source is endangered, and a definition of a communication protocol with your colleagues.

- Become familiar with the area and safe places where you can meet with sources.

- Build sources carefully. Sources that give you sensitive information have their own agenda and not always are concerned about your security.

- If you trust police agencies, let them know that you are about to enter the area. If you don’t trust them, let human rights and advocacy organizations that you are entering a dangerous area controlled by criminal gangs.

- Create a trusted network of colleagues, friends and relatives that will be aware of your presence in a high-risk zone and ready to act if an incident occurs.

- Prepare your devices to have an effective communication with colleagues, editors, and sources.

-  In general, we recommend keeping your independence as a journalist, to develop professional relationships with sources, to strengthen verification methods and practices and to ask often about Ethical limits in handling information and sources.
