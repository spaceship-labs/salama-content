## Privacy Policy

The Salama Project, a project of the Border Center for Journalists and Bloggers,  is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals we serve. We request and manage personal information only so individuals can apply for personalized advice on risk reduction. We never sell or share personal information. We ask for your personal information when you request communication and personalized advice from us or when you suggest a way to improve our platform. We use that information as outlined below.
If you subscribe to any of our mailing lists on the Salama or Border Center for Journalists and Bloggers, we ask only for your email address. You can unsubscribe at any time. To do so, there are simple instructions at the bottom of each email or you may contact us via the websites.
If you apply to an BCJB training program, we ask for your email address and basic contact information such as your Twitter handle, name of your organization and general information about where you are based in. We use this to inform you about acceptances and updates on the program. If you are accepted into an BCJB program, the information from your application will be used to facilitate your participation, as described below. We will delete your information after a period of three years.
If you participate in an BCJB program or work as a consultant for our programs, we will ask you to sign an agreement so that we can use your information to make travel plans, process visas, make payments, etc. This information may include your email address, general contact information, passport details and bank information. We will delete your information three years after the program has ended.
