# Be prepared for dangerous zones
Visiting dangerous zones without security protocols is a very risky, unsafe combination. Experienced reporters never assume they are safe at any time. For them, visiting a high-risk zone requires both preparedness and a permanent state of alert. Journalists need to be prepared with a lot of information about that area, and, at the same time, be prepared to face the unexpected. Security conditions may change at any time and catch you without proper preparation.
