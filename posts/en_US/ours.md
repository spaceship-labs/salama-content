# THE SALAMA PROJECT

Welcome to our site! Salama is a risk assessment application for journalists, human rights defenders and their organizations. To complete its mission, it has become a whole project to protect safety, privacy, data, sources and investigations of journalists and human rights defenders  who are doing sensitive investigations and fulfilling assignments in dangerous places.
WHAT WE DO
Risk assessment
With the Salama technology we developed, we help journalists and media organizations to get a risk assessment, decrease their own vulnerabilities and increase their capacities.
Training
We train journalists and entire newsrooms to reduce all kind of risks: from emotional to legal, from physical to digital risks.
Research
We use mapping tools to visualize data on journalists at risk and places where assignments may face serious security issues.

Toolbox
We train journalists to adopt curated digital security tools to protect their data, devices and communication.
